# Hi
This is our about page. If you see any spelling mistakes feel free to point them out as an issue or create a pr. If you want to join the organization and get your own page here, please create an issue on the repo. There are some stuff you should know about before joining. I will tell you those things when you create the issue. Also please try to have 1 month prior experience before trying to join the org as I will only then know that you have been using repl.it for some time and you are not just a person trying to delete everything and mess with using

## Website
In the website there is the main page which is the about page for our organization. It gives the reason why we made it and things like that. This website also has 'portfolios' or 'pages' for each of our organization members. The memebers are _supposed to_ make their own CSS and stuff but some of them are lazy and...you see the result. Hope you loike it, BOI!!
