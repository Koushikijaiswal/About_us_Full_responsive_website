<!-- I have removed everything as there were random stuff there. I recommend you add a class to your HTML tag and use that html.classname in the style.css file so everything is more clean. I want clean pages. All the CSS should be in style.css and your pages should not have links to random things. Have a clean head. Everything in the body tho can be AS MESSY AS YOU WANT 😁 Everyone should also be on the same page so if you make a change, no-matter how small it is, write it down in the READTHIS.md(at the bottom of the page there is the activity log). Also if I deleted something important go to the main branch IN GITHUB and see your files. This is a different branch right now and DO NOT CHANGE THE BRANCH HERE -->
