		<h2 class="center">A little about this page</h2>
		<p>
			I would really like to add lots of nice CSS and make this page look nice
			but then I would have to search off of the internet and that wouldn't be
			nice, would it. This page would only have the HTML and CSS to my extent so
			I don't really care if you hate on my CSS cause I know it is not that
			good.

		<h2 class="center">Intro</h2>
		<p>
			I am writing this during my SST class don't tell my teacher lul. I like
			coding but I get a little bit too addicted to my computer. This has been
			happening recently so I have kinda lessened the amount of time I am on the
			computer.
