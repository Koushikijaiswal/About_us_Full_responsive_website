    <h1 class="center">Hoi there!</h1>
    <p>I(<a href="https://repl.it/@Whippingdot">Whippingdot</a>) created this organization because I wanted to have an organization for us coders who use Repl.it. I wanted to create cool project with the fellow members without having to comment on random posts that I saw on repl talk. I also wanted to create project <strong>for</strong> Repl.it too without having to reveal the plan by commenting. The community here is fun and we always have chats with anyone. If you have a question on one of our projects, you can ask in an issue or disccusion and we will help.
    
    <h2 class="center">Joining</h2>
    <p>This organization is free to repl.it members, and you can give a message to use that you want to join in just a click of a few buttons in our <a href="/signup">Sign up page where you give us your repl.it profile link and your github profile link</a>. I recommend having a few months prior experience to GitHub though so you know how to use it. We have projects regularly and I think we finish around 3/4 project per year. The community will be very active, and even I will be active. You can always ping me on GitHub or repl.it and I will be free to help!</p>
