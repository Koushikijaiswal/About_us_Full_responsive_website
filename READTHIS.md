# This is our the page for everything(meaning TODO, ACTIVTY, and INSTRUCTIONS)

## INSTRUCTIONS

The Next project is underway. It will be a project just for ourselves. We will share it in repl talk too as it will have our portfolios. This project was mentioned by both @darkdarcool and @Isaiah08-D. It will be a project starring each and every person in our org's profile. This will be the about page for this org. There will be a navbar from which you can access the portfolios. The home page will just talk about the org and have the about, ~~with maybe my portfolio there cause I don't know how to make one **yet**~~ and then we will have a navbar which will have the links to everyone else's. Even in the footer we will have the other people's. We will also have a projects page and a secret page which is just random. We shud start working on this soon(as this project is WAY more complex then the 2020/2021 thing) so @AmazingMech2418, @BD103, @darkdarcool plan something for this. @BD103 u do css cause you hate mine, @darkdarcool do whatever you want(mostly the code), and @AmazingMech2418 like your mod perms try planning out the whole project. If you are not active on github and you don't see this it is ok as I will help, and @firefish111, @JBYT27, and @Codemonkey51 will all help too. @tsunami-or-something can also help with css, as so can @ColePete, @CodingRedpanda(previously ridark) and @CyanCoding(the 'C's). Everyone will help with the code too. Also if you want to be the main guy for something reply to this with what. I will copy this to the community discussions thing too. The three names at the start are the main people for their respective stuff(@AmazingMech2418 for planning, @darkdarcool for coding, and @BD103 for css and putting everyone under control). BOI BOI NOW i have exams i have to study will be free this weekend. ~~~ This message is on GitHub too btw.

## TODO

### Things to do

- [ ] Make the sign up page send to a file/db
- [ ] Add a good note for what this website is about. Underneath the about message write a good note for what this website is about
- [ ] Add content to secret page -- Right now make the routing work
- [ ] Add content to 404 page. Make it nice ~~and toasty~~ and good looking so people like it and understand that they reached the wrong page
- [ ] Add the pages for **_Every_** single person on the organisation
- [ ] Do the routing for all the pages first
- [ ] Add the contents. If org member has their own about page just ask them to add a a navbar or you add a navbar to their page which fits in with the style while also having the same thing the main navbar has. This means add their same about page but with an extra navbar that has the same things this website has.
- [ ] Finish the CSS. Make it look very nice. ~~BD103 pls no purple or pink. You can have those but in _small_ quantities~~ We need dark colors.
- [ ] Share post before my annual exams(end of next month which is March)
- [ ] Share again with more changes which we will think of later

### Finished

- [X] Add good note for about. This means write the 'about' of why this organisation is there
- [X] Tsunami forgot how to favicon load it up
- [X] Add background color
- [X] Make text color fit with background
- [X] Make all routing work for now
