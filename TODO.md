# This is our ROADMAP ~~trash right~~

## To Do
- [ ] Tsunami forgot how to favicon load it up
- [ ] Add good note for about. This means write the 'about' of why this organisation is there
- [ ] Add a good note for what this website is about. Underneath the about message write a good note for what this website is about
- [ ] Add content to secret page. i recommend headiscoding to do this cause he is ~~mental~~ good at spouting random stuff that is not innocent
- [ ] Add content to 404 page. Make it nice ~~and toasty~~ and good looking so people like it and understand that they reached the wrong page
- [ ] Add the pages for **_Every_** single person on the organisation
  - [ ] Do the routing for all the pages first
  - [ ] Add the contents. If org member has their own about page just ask them to add a a navbar or you add a navbar to their page which fits in with the style while also having the same thing the main navbar has. This means add their same about page but with an extra navbar that has the same things this website has.
- [ ] Finish the CSS. Make it look very nice. ~~BD103 pls no purple or pink. You can have those but in _small_ quantities~~ We need dark colors.
- [ ] Share post before my annual exams(end of next month which is March)
- [ ] Share again with more changes which we will think of later

## Finished
- [X] Add background color
- [X] Make text color fit with background
- [X] Make all routing work for now
